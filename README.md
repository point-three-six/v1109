# V1109

At a physically controlled entry point (e.g.: aircraft hangar), visitors that are being escorted must sign a physical paper-copy 1109 form.

To accelerate this process, the V1109 project aims to create a user-friendly virtual UI combined with a physical barcode scanner.
This enables visitors to simply scan their IDs instead of taking the time to fill out all required sections of the form.
